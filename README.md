# Login

This is my solution to the test. It mocks a login process. It displays an alert on successful login.

<img 
  src="public/login.png" 
  alt="Alt text" 
  title="Login Screenshot"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 700px">
  >

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

I used react testing library to write 2 simple test.
